🌟 **Project: AiChatBot – Your AI-Powered Web Companion**
AiChatBot is a smart and user-friendly chatbot web application that I built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It integrates with Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash API to allow users to have real-time, intelligent conversations—and even send images for the AI to interpret. The goal was to create an interactive, smooth, and fully responsive chat experience from scratch.

🔥 What Makes This Project Special?
Talk to AI in Real-Time: Users can ask questions or start a conversation, and the bot replies instantly using Gemini 2.5 Flash API.

Image Upload Support: You’re not limited to just typing! Users can upload images, which are sent as base64 data to the AI for multimodal understanding.

Typing Animation: To make the chat feel alive, a typing/loading animation is shown while the AI is responding.

Responsive UI: Whether on desktop or mobile, the layout adjusts beautifully to keep the experience smooth.

Looks Great, Works Great: I paid attention to design—adding avatars, clean bubbles for messages, theme consistency, and neat scroll animations.

🧰 **Tech Stack**
👨‍💻 **Frontend**
HTML5 – The building blocks of the UI

CSS3 – For layout, colors, responsiveness, and styling

JavaScript – To handle interactions, messaging logic, and API calls

FileReader API – Reads image files uploaded by the user

💬 **What I Learned**
Building AiChatBot helped me sharpen my frontend skills, especially around:

Integrating real-world APIs (Gemini)

Handling media uploads in a browser

Creating smooth, mobile-first user interfaces

Working with JSON and asynchronous requests in JavaScript

This project pushed me to think about both user experience and backend communication, making it a great hands-on example of what I can build independently.

**📌 Conclusion**
Developing AiChatBot has enhanced my understanding of integrating external AI APIs with frontend technologies and working with real-time user interaction workflows. It reflects my ability to build intelligent web apps with an emphasis on user experience, interface design, and API integration.
